## Sinatra Project Time!!

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/B8NSo2tYq4SRi/giphy.gif)

This Sinatra web app should:
* be a simple content management system (CMS)
* utilize CRUD and MVC structure
* use ActiveRecord with Sinatra 

Now not to be a one-trick pony, but when I read that this application should track something important to you, I just knew I was going to make a TIKI DRINK TRACKER. 

You can take the tiki drink away from the girl, but can't get the girl away from tiki drinks. C'est la vie. 

I HAVE other interests. I promise. 

Waffles and cats.

But that's it. 

ANYWAYS

### The TIKIPHILES

The Tikiphiles is a place for anyone to join so they can record and rate each tiki drink they imbibe. 

Knowing what to order (or never order again!) is half the battle. 

#### Basic Features
* once a user has signed up they can view - all drinks uploaded by every user on the community homepage or  a personal homepage to view all their own drinks
* the user can create, edit, and delete a drink 
* a drink has a name, type, bar & location, a rating out of 0-10, and an optional image 

#### Getting Started
So the steps I followed to bring this website into the world:
1. build out the basic file structure 
2. set up the git repo 
3. set up the mechanics to get the site wired up correctly a l√° a Gemfile, config.ru, env.rb, .gitignore, etc.
4. build out the ApplicationController, which inherits from Sinatra::Base 
5. test by running `shotgun` and check in the browser at `localhost:9393`
6. make a Rakefile and console task for testing
7. add the models and set up their associations
8. create a database, migrate it, and seed it
9. build other controllers and make sure they are mounted in the config.ru
10. go to town coding the routes and views 

Now I would just like to take a small detour here to address #2 "set up the git repo"...

If you ever find yourself displeased with your beginnings of a project and
you are feeling a dangrous combination of dramatic and frustrated 
so you delete it ALL including the repo on your Github
and start over in a haste and run a  `git init` in the root directory of your computer...

VSCode will be very upset with you. It will get overwhelmed trying to stage EVERY FILE ON YOUR COMPUTER.

And you will be very upset trying to figure out what you've done and send an SOS to your cohort lead. 

IN SUMMARY - pay close attention to where you run a  `git init`  command.

Moving on...

The dreaded "undefined method for nil:NilClass" error. 

While cruising along in the last step,  #10 "go to town coding the routes and views", everything was going smoothly until the Update portion of my CRUD was not working. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/hNOIIvmt.png)

This line of code `@drink = Drink.find_by(id: params[:id])`  , my @drink variable was coming up nil. It wasn't finding the right drink in the database, but why?

So I threw in a binding.pry to find out what params[:id] I was receiving.

Turns out the id was coming through as "edit". Oh boy. So now I had to go track down the form in my Edit View to see why it was passing off "edit" as the id and low and behold I had set the form's action to 
```
<form action="/drinks/<% @drink.id %>/edit" method="POST">
```
when it should have been 
```
<form action="/drinks/<%= @drink.id %>" method="POST">
```

Overall, this project has been fun and I can't wait to add more functionality to it in the future! Cheers!!
