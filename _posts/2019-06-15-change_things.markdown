I love a challenge and I want to always be learning. Web development fits the bill for a future full of challenges and continous learning. I come from an art background and like to build/create with my hands so here's my chance to abstract that to the web.

When I was looking through the vast sea of online education and bootcamp options, there were a few parameters that I compared such as:
* time commitment
* cost
* success rate of the students

This left me with three top choices. Next, I considered which of the three scared me the most AKA would push me out of my comfort zone. It became glaringly obvious to me that the course that would demand the most from me would be Flatiron. I am SHY. Communicating clearly and effectively with others does not come natural to me. The mere thought of having someone watch me think and assess my coding abilities...

But Flatiron's investment in their students is clear and so encouraging. The design of the course, with its weekly 1:1's, pair programming and blogging requirements, sounds terrible *cough* I mean GREAT. 
It was obvious to me that I needed to choose this school because those things would make me a better programmer and help me grow as a person.
